# Technologies
The frontend was made with **React** using **Typescript** and **Vite** as Javascript bundler. All the component styling was made by me using **SCSS** with the exception of the Select and Menu components, for this ones I used **Ant Design** component library. For the state management and API calls I used **Redux** with **Redux Toolkit**.
